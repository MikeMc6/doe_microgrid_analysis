The CPUC opened the rulemaking (R.10-12-007) on December 19, 2010. The rulemaking consisted of several phases of workshops, modeling of energy systems, staff reports, proposed decisions, and stakeholder input. The full timeline of the rulemaking process, as well as many pieces of documentation, can be found at http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/electric/storage.htm.

At its October 17, 2013 meeting, the Commission adopted a 1.325 GW procurement target for energy storage by 2020, with biannual targets increasing every two years from 2016-2020. The targets were further broken up by ""use case buckets"" (transmission-connected, distribution-connected, and behind-the-meter) and by each of California's three Investor Owned Utilities (IOUs). Electric Service Providers and Community Choice Aggregators were directed to procure energy storage resources equivalent to 1% of their peak capacity by 2020.

Project Number 39657		Public Utility Commission of Texas	http://www.puc.texas.gov/agency/rulesnlaws/subrules/electric/25.5/39657adt.pdf	The Commission opened three rules to address issues related to storage. The first project, Project Number 39657, was a rulemaking to Implement SB 943 relating to Electric Energy Storage Equipment or Facilities. In November 2011, the Commission adopted amendments to §25.5. The amendments added references to energy storage equipment and facilities as required by SB 943 of the 82nd Legislature, Regular Session in 2011 (SB 943). This rule included electric energy storage equipment or facilities under the definition of a power generation company providing clarity regarding the interconnection of energy storage equipment and facilities.

Project Number 39917		Public Utility Commission of Texas	http://www.puc.texas.gov/agency/rulesnlaws/subrules/electric/25.501/39917adt.pdf	"In the second project, Project Number 39917, the Commission opened a rulemaking on energy storage issues in response to issues raised in the October 2011 workshop. In March 2012 the Commission adopted amendments to §25.192 relating to transmission service rates, and §25.501, relating to wholesale market design for the ERCOT region. The Commission determined that energy used to charge a storage facility is a wholesale transaction. Certain ancillary services are for the benefit of retail load and their costs are allocated to entities serving retail load on a load-ratio-share or per megawatt-hour basis.
The ERCOT protocols provide that generators are compensated for energy on a nodal pricing basis while loads pay for energy on a zonal basis. The nodal price, or the price of energy for any specific location, will change based on grid congestion. The zonal price is the average price of the nodes within a particular zone. There are currently eight zones in ERCOT. While energy storage acts as a load when it withdraws energy, the

storage facility does not ultimately consume this energy, and uses it for regeneration at a later time. Therefore, the Commission sought to treat storage load at the nodal price instead of at the zonal price that is applied to end-use consumption. This difference between nodal and zonal pricing could have diminished the economic efficiency with regard to the location and operation of storage technologies. Applying the nodal price to storage load would offer a locational signal for the efficient siting and economical operation of storage facilities.
The Commission recognized that a distinction of wholesale electrical load for storage devices was reasonable where a storage device, regardless of the specific technology, takes power from the grid, converts it to potential energy, and at a more opportune time transforms this potential energy back into electric energy, which is returned to the grid (less conversion losses). Storage devices thus differ fundamentally from other loads because the power taken from the grid is not consumed in the manufacturing of goods or the provision of services. In this respect, there is a clear distinction between storage assets and other types of load when taking energy from the grid. During the rulemaking it became evident that the concept of an ERCOT pilot project should be investigated."

Long-Term Procurement Planning: Rulemaking 12-03-014	12-03-014	California Public Utilities Commission	http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/SearchRes.aspx?DocFormat=ALL&DocID=50374520	" This CPUC rule-making is part of the state's long-term procurement planning (LTPP), which authorizes the state's investor owned utilities (IOUs) to procure certain amounts of electricity capacity and directs those utilities to purchase at least a certain amount of various listed capacity resources. At the broad scale, this rulemaking ""authorizes Southern California Edison (SCE) to procure between 1,400 and 1,800 megawatts (MW) of electrical capacity in the West Los Angeles sub-area of the Los Angeles (LA) base and local reliability area to meet long-term local capacity requirements (LCRs) by 2021. SCE is also authorized to procure between 215 and 290 MW of the Moorpark sub-area of the Big Creek/Ventura local reliability area.""

 This was a landmark ruling because it was the first state decision directing an IOU to procure a certain amount of energy storage capacity (in this case, 50 MW). It also states that “energy storage resources should be considered along with preferred resources,” and that the two categories may be procured up to 800 MW total capacity. Regarding this, the rulemaking states that “at least 50 MW [of capacity] must be procured from energy storage resources. At least 150 MW of capacity must be procured through preferred resources consistent with the Loading Order in the Energy Action Plan, or energy storage resources. SCE is also authorized to procure up to an additional 600 MW of capacity from preferred resources and/or energy storage resources.” In this case, SCE is directed to procure 50 MW of energy storage capacity, but is authorized to procure up to 800 MW if it so chooses (assuming no other preferred resources are procured).

SCE is directed to begin a procurement process and have applications for the CPUC ready by late 2013 or early 2014."	February 13, 2013			Investor Owned				All			All			Procurement authorization	Preferred resource status		All	15.02.2013 22:45:33

In the regulation market, resources provide rapid fluctuations in output in order to match systemwide supply and demand. This occurs largely in wholesale markets spanning transmission lines, which are regulated under FERC. Order 755 changed the regulation compensation schemes to reward faster-ramping resources with greater payments in the wholesale frequency regulation markets. This especially impacted fast-acting energy storage systems, which are often well-suited for frequency regulation due to their fast ramping capabilities. Those faster-ramping, more accurate resources are now given greater compensation in the wholesale frequency regulation markets.	20.10.2011			All				All			Frequency Regulation			Frequency regulation compensation				25.10.2013 00:19:14
