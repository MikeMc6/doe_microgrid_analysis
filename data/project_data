The advanced energy storage installation provides critical contingency services to maintain the stability of the electric grid in Northern Chile, an important mining area. It continuously monitors the condition of the power system and if a significant frequency deviation occursâ€”for example, the loss of a generator or transmission lineâ€”the energy storage system is capable of providing up to 20MW of power nearly instantaneously. This output is designed to be maintained for 15 minutes at full power, allowing the system operator to resolve the event or bring other standby units online.

In the event of a generation or transmission related outage, it can provide 27 megawatts of power for 15 minutes. That's enough time for the co-op to start up local generation when there are problems with the Intertie or power plants in Anchorage.

One of the requirements for construction of the Intertie was a reactive power supply capable of delivering power should generation fail. At the heart of the world's most powerful energy storage battery are two core components: the Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cad) batteries, developed by Saft, and the converter, designed and supplied by ABB. The converter changes the batteries' DC power into AC power ready for use in GVEA's transmission system.

Awards Received:

- ABB was awarded the Platts 2003 Global Energy Award for their design and development of the BESS converter.
- The Electric Power Resarch Institue Technology Award for the BESS project at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association Annual Meeting on February 15 2004.
- Guiness World Record certificate acknowledging that the BESS is the world's most powerful battery on December 10, 2003. During a test of its maximum limit, it discharged 46 megawatts for five minutes

Statistics:

- 13,760 liquid electrolyte-filled Ni-Cad cells

Overall, BOB provides the following benefits:

-  Due to its quick response, the battery will address voltage fluctuations and momentary outages.  
-  In the event of an outage on the radial transmission line providing power to Presidio, the battery can supply four megawatts of uninterrupted power for up to eight hours. This will also allow for a transfer of electricity sourcing from the Texas grid to that of neighboring ComisiÏŒn Federal de Electricidad (CFE) during emergency situations. This process can often take several hours.

Eagle Crest Energy obtained exclusive rights to study the site for development of a hydroelectric project from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Using open mind hits as reservoirs, the Eagle Mountain Pumped Storage Project will store water in an upper reservoir for later release through an underground power plant to the lower reservoir, generating electricity during peak hours when it is needed most.

The Eagle Mountain Pumped Storage Project will utilize four 325 MW reversible hydroelectric turbines to provide 1300 MW of firm, stable, and dispatchable power when needed. It will provide electricity during the peak electrical demand periods, unexpected generation outages, and help correct and balances in the southwestern grid. Through its ability to store the off-peak energy produced by windmills, solar panels, and baseload nuclear and fossil fuel plants, this single project can accomplish the equivalent of many smaller peak-energy projects. This project will also help make renewable wind and solar projects fully integrated, reliable generation sources.

Like the Huntorf plant, the McIntosh Unit 1 facility stores compressed air in a solution-mined salt cavern. The cavern is 220 ft in diameter and 1,000 ft tall, for a total volume of 10 million cubic feet. At full charge, the cavern is pressurized to 1,100 psi, and it is discharged down to 650 psi. During discharge, 340 pounds of air flow out of the cavern each second. The cavern can discharge for 26 hours. The plant also utilizes nuclear-sourced night-time power for compression and then produces peak power during the day by releasing the compressed air into a 110-MW gas-fired combustion turbine built by Dresser Rand. The turbine unit also makes use of an air-to-air heat exchanger to preheat air from the cavern with waste heat from the turbine. The waste heat recovery system reduces fuel usage by roughly 25%. 

Compared to conventional combustion turbines, the CAES-fed system can start up in 15 minutes rather than 30 minutes, uses only 30% to 40% of the natural gas, and operates efficiently down to low loads (about 25% of full load).

The goal is to deliver a cost-effective prototype flywheel system that can be grid connected and electrically charged and discharged. The system will have built-in sensing components that can determine frequency and voltage characteristics of the grid and can override the grid signal to manage the amount of electricity discharged. The flywheel stores energy in a spinning rotor that is connected to an electric motor that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. To recover the energy the motor is electrically reversed and used as a generator to slow down the flywheel converting the mechanical energy back into electrical energy. Amber Kinetics will improve the traditional flywheel system by engineering breakthroughs in three areas, resulting in higher efficiency and radically reduced cost: magnetic bearings, low-cost rotor, and high-efficiency motor generator. This technology can also be used to optimize existing infrastructure.

The 48-month project contains 3 phases. 
Phase 1: engineering of a 10kW/10kWh prototype system, includes demonstration of flywheel system, rotor performance, and demonstration of low-loss bearings and motor (Completed)
Phase 2: commercial-scale prototype development, includes 100 kWh flywheel energy storage systems, with focus on scale up and cost reductions
Phase 3: grid-connected demonstration, includes MWh size grid-connected demonstration of system performance and cycle life.

Aquionâ€™s final deliverable was an ~15 kWh system, dubbed an aqueous hybrid ion (AHI) battery, that has the ability to perform medium to long duration (> 2 hours) charge and discharge functions approaching 95% DC-DC efficiency. The system has functioned, and continues to function as predicted with no indication that it will not tolerate well beyond 10 calendar years and 10,000 cycles. It has been in continuous operation for more than 1 year with 1,000 cycles (of varying depth of discharge, including 100% depth of discharge) and no identifiable degradation to the system. The final thick electrode cell structure has shown an energy density of 25 kWh/m3 at a five hour (or greater) discharge time. The primary chemistry has remained non-toxic, containing no acids or other corrosive chemicals, and the battery units have passed numerous safety tests, including flame resistance testing. These tests have verified the claim that the device is safe to use and contains no hazardous materials.  Current projections show costs at the pack level to offer best in class value and are competitive with lead-acid batteries, factoring in LCOE.

The final deliverable system for the DOE award was assembled in late 2011 and testing began shortly thereafter. This system consists of 270 Battery 0 units connected in series, with a footprint of 45 x 58 x 60 (LxWxH) and weighing approximately 2800 lbs. It should be noted that a significant portion of this weight and footprint is a temporary racking system that allows for varying pressure to be placed on the batteries to test for gassing and a conductivity issues. The system has been in continuous operation since early 2012, and continued in operation until July 2013 with no performance degradation in the chemistry.

In the Tohoku-Area Japan, for the wind farm to be connected to the grid and sell the generated electricity to the utility, the output from the system must be kept within 10% of the rated output of the wind generation in a randomly selected 20 minute time range.  The LL-W is a specially developed VRLA(Valve Regulated Lead Acid) battery to be used at PSOC (Partial State of Charge suited for stabilizing the output fluctuation from the wind generation, and with an expected lifetime of 17 years.  As lead acid batteries are a cost efficient technology, especially combined with the long life of the LL-W which requires no major additional costs, such as replacements, the system contributes to the cost reduction of the overall project.

Keys III Pump-Generating Plant (formerly known as Grand Coulee Pump-Generating Plant) pumps water uphill 280 feet from Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake to Banks Lake. This water is used to irrigate approximately 670,000 acres of farmland in the Columbia Basin Project. More than 60 crops are grown in the basin and distributed across the nation

Construction of the irrigation facilities began in 1948. Components of the project include the pump-generating plant, feeder canal, and equalizing reservoir, which was later named Banks Lake. Banks Lake was formed by damming the northern 27 miles of the Grand Coulee, and has an active storage capacity of 715,000 acre-feet. The lake stores water for irrigation and also provides important recreational benefits to the region. The pump-generating plant began operation in 1951. From 1951 to 1953, six pumping units, each rated at 65,000 horsepower and with a capacity to pump 1,600 cubic feet per second, were installed in the plant. In the early 1960s, investigations revealed the potential for power generation. Reversible pumps were installed to allow water from Banks Lake to flow back through the units to generate power during periods of peak demand. The first three generating pumps came online in 1973. Two more generating pumps were installed in 1983; the final generating pump was installed in January 1984. The total generating capacity of the plant is now 314,000 kilowatts. In 2008, the pump-generating plant was renamed in honor of John W. Keys III. Keys was Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation from 2001 to 2006 and Pacific Northwest Regional Director from 1986 to 1998.

Due to passing clouds, solar energy output was observed to rapidly fluctuate; cases were observed where over 80% of a solar unit's output would drop in less than five seconds.  This rapid fluctuation in circuit power flows can cause undesirable voltage conditions that are significant for existing infrastructure to correct. To solve this, a battery system was envisioned that charged and discharged to absorb the solar-induced ""power swings"", allowing the circuit's voltage profile to remain smooth despite significant and rapid changes to the power flows along it. 

Duke has arranged 12 batteries manufactured by the Italian company FIAMM for use in series in hybrid electric buses to make a 402-kilowatt battery.
It is used to smooth out large minute-by-minute spikes and troughs in production from the 1.2-megawatt rooftop solar project Duke operates about a mile away.  The Rankin project is designed to give Duke hard data on what would be the smallest battery that could be used to reduce these swings effectively.

When energy demand is high, water is released from the upper reservoir to the plant where electricity is generated before the water is discharged into the lower reservoir. When demand is low at times such as night, water is then pumped back up to the upper reservoir to be used as stored energy for a later time. This is accomplished by pump-generators which serve a dual role as both pumps which can reverse into generators. The plant can go from a stand still to operational in eight minutes which allows it to meet peak energy demand. It consumes more electricity pumping versus generating electricity but pumping occurs during periods of low demand, making the plant economical.

The plant was built between 1969-73 and is jointly owned by Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison, and operated by Consumers Energy.
The plant contributes directly to local governments about $11 million in annual property taxes.  Revenue from plant operations, maintenance and overhauls also contribute significant sums to the local economy.  Local residents still refer to the plant as â€œThe Projectâ€.

One of the worldâ€™s biggest electric â€œbatteriesâ€, Ludington can provide energy at a momentâ€™s notice. Its ability lies in its 27-billion gallon reservoir and a set of six turbines that drive electric generators.  Those same turbines double as giant water pumps to fill the reservoir with water from Lake Michigan.
At night, when electric demand is low, Ludingtonâ€™s reversible turbines pump water 363 feet uphill from Lake Michigan. The water is pumped through six large pipes, or â€œpenstocksâ€, to the 842-acre reservoir. During the day, when electric demand is high, the reservoir releases water to flow downhill through the penstocks. The flowing water turns turbines and generators in the powerhouse to make electricity.
The plant can generate up to 1,872 megawatts â€” enough electricity to serve a community of 1.4 million residential customers. The output is more than double the capacity of any single unit on Consumers Energyâ€™s system.
Ludingtonâ€™s relatively simple technology enables the plant to respond quickly to the daily, weekly and seasonal highs and lows of Michiganâ€™s energy demand. The plant also saves customers money by enabling Consumers Energy to avoid the expensive spot market when customer demand exceeds the capacity of the companyâ€™s baseload plants.  The immense size of Ludington and its six-unit design offers flexibility in balancing customer demand with electric output on a momentâ€™s notice. 

Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison announced an $800 million upgrade on February 7 2011.

The Bad Creek facility utilizes two reservoirs (or lakes) to generate electricity: an upper reservoir and a lower reservoir. Water stored in an upper lake is released into underground power tunnels. The water rushes down the tunnels, driving huge turbines, which are underground at the base of a dam. The spinning turbines are connected to large generators, which produce the electricity. The water then flows through draft tubes into a lower lake.

A pumped-storage hydroelectric station uses the same water over and over again, making more efficient use of water resources. When demand for electricity is low, operators can refill the lake, as if they were â€œrechargingâ€ a battery.

New Waddell Dam's primary purpose is to store Colorado River water for CAP use. The dam also stores Agua Fria River runoff and provides flood protection by controlling river flows. The dam is located one-half mile downstream of historic Waddell Dam, which was built by the Maricopa Water District (MWD). The dam's reservoir, Lake Pleasant, also stores water for MWD irrigation.

In the winter, Colorado River water is pumped uphill from the CAP aqueduct into Lake Pleasant when power rates are low. In the summer, when demand for water and electricity increases, water is released through the Pump-Generating plant, producing hydroelectric power that is sold to help repay the CAP's construction costs. In addition, New Waddell Dam adds 7,000 surface acres to the lake, greatly increasing the recreational value of Lake Pleasant Regional Park.

Handicapped-accessible recreational facilities include 3 multiple-lane boat ramps, 450 picnic sites, 225 campsites, 14 group use areas, 4 overlooks, a full-service marina equipped to handle 1000 boats, and 7 miles of trail. Because the reservoir water level may fluctuate up to 125 feet during a typical year's operation, the facilities will be located to be accessible during both high and low water periods.

If necessary, floodwaters can be released from the dam through the river outlet works tunnel into the Agua Fria River immediately below the dam. If the reservoir's flood storage capacity is ever exceeded, water can also be released over spillways located west of the dam. This water would flow down Morgan City Wash and back to the Agua Fria River about one mile below the dam.

The cost of constructing New Waddell Dam was more than $625 million. The Central Arizona Water Conservation District, which operates and maintains the CAP, is repaying $175 million of this cost.",http://www.usbr.gov/lc/phoenix/projects/waddelldamproj.html,,01.01.1985,01.01.1994,,N/A,,,Transmission,,Third-Party-Owned,Bureau of Reclamation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pumping Capacity: 3,000 cfs",625000000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dan DuBray,ddubray@usbr.gov,202-513-0574,,,,,,25.04.2013 20:45:49,03.05.2013 15:46:04,,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nestled beneath 2,000-foot-tall Brown Mountain, this project generates more than one million kilowatts of electricity in peak demand periods by drawing water from Schoharie Creek and recycling it between two huge reservoirs.

Blenheim-Gilboa serves two vital functions. It saves money for New York consumers by providing low-cost electricity when they need it most. And it stores water for emergency power production. If necessary, this project can be up and running within two minutes. It can ""pinch hit"" if another plant or line suddenly goes out of service.

A $135-million four-year program to modernize and extend the life of the Blenheim-Gilboa project was completed in May 2010. As part of the four-year program, known as LEM (Life Extension and Modernization), one of projectâ€™s four turbine-generator units was taken out of service each fall for approximately eight months. Most of the unitâ€™s mechanical and electrical components were replaced, with repairs made to virtually all other parts. With completion of the project, the four units have a generating capacity of 290 megawatts each, providing an overall project generating capacity of 1,160 megawatts.

Following testing at its Dolan Technology Center near Columbus, OH, the utility became the first U.S. electric company to deploy NaS batteries in 2002 when it installed and operated a 100kW/500kVA demonstration unit in Gahanna, OH. In 2006, AEP installed a 1.2-MW stationary NaS battery near Charleston, WV. And in 2008, the utility installed three, 2-MW NaS batteries: one in Churubusco, IN.; one in Milton, WV; and one in Bluffton, OH. The 7.2 MW in NaS deployments are part of AEPâ€™s electricity storage strategy that will also include transportable stationary batteries and distributed small scale energy storage systems.

AEP deployed all of its NaS installations as a means to provide load leveling and alleviate transformer loading during summer peaks, defer capital upgrades, and offer emergency backup power to several hundred customers during electrical system outages. Ultimately, the NaS units offer AEP a degree of flexibility in determining the optimal approach for handling reliability problems. The units buy the utility time to decide whether to redesign a substation, build generation, or keep the storage units in place permanently. (All of the NaS systems are capable of being relocated for an estimated $85,000 to $115,000 if and when the companyâ€™s needs for storage change.)

AEPâ€™s 2-MW units were deployed in 2008, and are capable of providing islanding (backup power) for over seven hours when loss of utility power from the substation occurs. These newer installations can also perform load-triggered load leveling which, for example, allows the batteries to discharge just enough energy to hold a constrained substation transformer constant. As a result, a greater amount of energy can be reserved for islanding and battery life can be extended due to less frequent discharging.

AEP uses an in-house SCADA system and developed custom software to control all of its batteries based on the loading transformer. The software essentially creates a feedback loop where the load of the transformer is compared to a desired maximum, and the battery output is then adjusted to achieve that maximum.

In addition, the unit sited at the Balls Gap substation in Milton, WV successfully islanded approximately 700 customers for roughly 30 minutes during a simulated outage staged on July 8, 2009. A live islanding event, meanwhile, took place in December 2009, during a snowstorm that islanded 25 customers for two days. Over that period, the Milton installation was able to minimize disruptions; customers experienced less than three minutes of continuous disruption during the two-day outage period.

Finally, on October 20, 2009, the Milton, WV battery was successfully operated to alleviate load and voltage concerns during a load transfer event between substations. While the transformer at one station was taken out of service for maintenance, load was transferred to a different station which caused voltage and loading concerns. The Milton battery was deployed and mitigated these concerns.

New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG) intended to build an advanced compressed air energy storage (CAES) plant with a rated capacity of 150 MW (2.4 GWh) using an existing 4.5 million cubic foot underground salt cavern in Reading, New York. The plant was to be sited between the bulk of U.S. wind resources and the heavy population centers of the East Coast. The plant will have the capacity to operate 16 hours a day and will provide energy arbitrage for approximately 2,300-2,500 hours each year. It will use off-peak electricity to compress air into the cavern. When electricity is needed the air will be withdrawn, heated, and passed through a turbine to drive an electric generator, burning one-third the amount of fuel compared to conventional combustion turbines. NYSEGâ€™s CAES plant will provide flexible generation capability to accommodate fluctuations in load. The plant will be tied to NYSEGâ€™s cross-state 230 kV/345 kV transmission system that feeds major metropolitan centers in Central New York. The 230 kV line is the recipient of a large proportion of wind power and is tied to the New York City load areas. It will provide redundancy in capacity, ensure against congestion and power fluctuations, and can provide improved power quality to the grid. Iberdrola USA, the parent of NYSEG, plans to conduct a feasibility study in the future to determine the ability to increase the plantâ€™s capacity to 360 MW or greater.",http://www.smartgrid.gov/project/new_york_state_electric_and_gas_advanced_compressed_air_energy_storage,30.11.2010,,,,NYISO,New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG),Investor Owned,Transmission,,Utility-Owned,New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG),,,,,,,,Iberdrola USA,,,,,,Performance metrics not available.,125006103,,Federal/National American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 â€“ RD&D,"Department of Energy, Office of Electricity - ARRA Smart Grid Demonstration Program",29561142,,,,,,,,,,James Rettberg,jwrettberg@nyseg.com,607-762-8813,,,,,,02.05.2013 23:03:58,05.09.2014 14:35:55,TRUE,,TRUE,,,,TRUE,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,

Such combined machine sets that are flexible and continuously adapt their performance both in turbine operation in power generation and in pumping mode of energy supply to the requirements and thus can be operated with the optimum efficiency were previously taken only in operation in Japan.

The high Alpine project area for the pumped storage power plant Reisseck II is located in MÃ¼hldorfer Graben at a height of up to 2,300 metres (m) where the Great MÃ¼hldorfer Lake will later function as an upper basin. The cavern power plant Reisseck II will be erected 1,585 m above sea level in the mountain and equipped with two powerful pump turbines.

Similar to a normal storage power plant, Reisseck II will produce peak electricity in high demand periods, whereby water will be transported via a works water channel from Great MÃ¼hldorfer Lake to the two turbines that drive the generators. The processed water will run into a lower basin.

Both of the machines units in the mountain can be switched to pump operation, whereby the generators will then function as motors and the turbines will pump the water from the lower basin back up to the upper basin. Pump operation will take place during the day when the European grid is carrying more electricity than is required by the consumers. Energy which, for example, comes from the large wind farms or the Danube power plants can be saved in the form of pumped-up water. The pumped storage power plant Reisseck II will therefore function as a ""green battery"" in the Alps. The power plant will have a capacity of 430 megawatt (MW), both in turbine and pump operation. This corresponds to the electricity generating capacity of approximately 200 wind turbines.

On completion of the rock cavern for the power plant in 2011, the boring of the works water channel to Great MÃ¼hldorfer Lake commenced in the first half of 2012 with an 880-ton (t) and 220 m tunnel boring machine. The assembly work on Austria's largest power plant construction site commenced in summer 2012. 300 experts are currently working on this high Alpine site. The newest VERBUND pumped storage power plant Reisseck II will be commissioned in 2014. The total investment volume amounts to â‚¬ 385 million.

A 200-ton transformer works its way up to Reisseck power plant

In the project Reisseck II, assembly work is going full speed ahead. Of all power plant components, the block transformer with a tare weight of 200 tons is the heaviest single component.

The transformer was delivered to Spittal on the river Drau by rail. Several tractive units harnessed in front of the transformer heaved it from the MÃ¶lltal valley to the power plant cavern, located 1000 meters higher â€“ a logistic challenge!

This area includes approximately 110,000 meters and 70 distribution circuits. AEP Ohio will implement Smart Grid technology over 58 13kV circuits from 10 distribution stations and 12 34.5kV circuits from six distribution stations. Included in this project is a redistribution management system, integrated volt-VAR control, distribution automation, advanced meter infrastructure, home area networks, community energy storage, sodium sulfur battery storage, and renewable generation sources. These technologies will be combined with two-way consumer communication and information sharing, demand response, dynamic pricing, and consumer products, such as plug-in hybrid vehicles.

The plan was to integrate 80 CES (25kW/25kWh) units of storage resources into the existing grid. After initial testing, AEP Ohio began field installations and commissioned 15 CES units into operations by December 31, 2011. Following this deployment, technical issues were discovered and the CES units were not performing to AEP Ohioâ€™s stringent standards. The CES units were removed from the field and returned to S&C. This component of the project has been redefined to include a limited deployment of four CES units at an outdoor test environment on AEP Ohio property to continue extensive testing.

(MHI), jointly with Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution (SHEPD), has begun an energy storage system demonstration project using the distribution grid in the UK's Orkney Islands, which has a high penetration of renewable energy. The project aims at demonstrating power supply stabilization in the region by introducing a container-housed large capacity energy storage system using lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, with a power output/input capability of 2MW (megawatts). The storage system will be handed over for operation in the middle of 2013.
 
The demonstration project is conducted with the support of New Energy and Industrial Technology Development organization (NEDO) of Japan, under the """"Development of Technology for Safe, Low-cost, Large-size Battery System"""" programme. In the project, Mitsubishi Power Systems Europe, Ltd. (MPSE), the business base for MHI's power system operations in Europe, will jointly provide the energy storage service to Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution plc (SHEPD) The funding for the project is being provided to SHEPD from OFGEM, under it's Tier 1 Low Carbon Network Fund.

The energy storage system, which has the capacity to store approximately 800kWh (kilowatt hour) nominal, 500kWh normal usage, consists of two 40ft containers for the batteries and a 40ft container for the power conditioning system. Each battery container houses more than 2,000 units of lithium-ion rechargeable batteries and its management system. The power conditioning system container houses a system for conversion of direct current (DC)/alternating current (A/C) and the associated input/output controls.

The energy storage system will be installed at SHEPD's Kirkwall Power Station. In the cases of power shortage or power surplus on the Orkney Islands, power is transmitted from/to the mainland through two 33kV submarine cables. When there is too much renewable energy, exceeding the export capacity of the cable to the mainland, the energy storage system will import part of the excess energy, reducing the need to constrain renewable generation on the islands, by reducing or stopping generator export.""

This could be the largest deployment of Ice Bears and provides participants an ability to achieve Utility-scale peak demand reduction and shifting of air conditioner load, while also providing valued efficiency improvements for individual commercial and industrial (C/I) customers - without sacrificing customer comfort.  To date, 7 members and 2 other POUs have installed approximately 2.5MW of TES capacity in more than 200 customer's facilities.  

These installations have provided participants new opportunities to work with C/I customers in partnership to help them cost-effectively reduce peak demand and shift energy usage to the off-peak period.  In addition, the SCPPA agreement with Ice Energy requires that local engineers and HVAC contractors be used for the design and installation processes and that supplies and materials be acquired locally, to the greatest extent possible to provide local and regional economic development opportunities in the communities served by the participants.

In essence, participants are purchasing and installing the Ice Bears and related equipment with little or no monetary contribution from the customers.  This business model is considered to be optimal, particularly for initial deployment, because utilities are the recipients of the most value or benefits from the PLS technology.  That is, while customers may see reduced on-peak usage, unless they are on TOU rates, there may not be much (if any) reduction in their bill and energy savings from the TES.  However there are significant operational, economic, and environmental benefits inherent with peak load shifting that are achieved by electric utilities who implement energy storage programs including, but not limited to: avoidance on-peak generation, operation and/or construction; improved load factor and ""flattening"" of load curves; reducing minimum load conditions and assimilation of intermittent renewable resources that also might be delivered off-peak; and reducing or removing constraints on overloaded distribution circuits or feeders to help defer or avoid capital intensive system improvements.

Equipped with AllCell's proprietary thermal management technology, the battery is continuously protected from overheating to ensure safety and prolonged battery life.

Development of the Evanston, IL based project was managed by Windfree, and includes a 10 kilowatt solar canopy, 40 kilowatt-hour battery system, and two Level II charging stations.

One of the charging stations is used exclusively by car sharing firm I-GO, while the other is available to the public. Alternative Transportation for Chicagoland owns the installation, and other project partners included architects Farr Associates and Continental Electric Construction Company.

""As more and more electric vehicles are sold each year, the strains on the electrical grid will continue to increase,"" said AllCell CEO Said Al-Hallaj.

The combination of on-site generation and on-site storage co-located with EV charging stations will be a critical part of ensuring that continued growth in the EV market doesn't disrupt the normal operation of the electrical grid.

According to WindFree President Doug Snower, ""The combination of advanced battery technology incorporated with our solar canopy EV charging stations make this a dream project for Windfree. We look forward to sharing open source data through a web base monitoring portal that will demonstrate utility infrastructure benefits and energy savings.""

The relevance of this plant lies in its technological uniqueness, since it opens up the way for new thermosolar electrical generation technology.

Characteristics of Gemasolar:

Rated electrical power: 19.9 MW
Solar field: 2,650 heliostats on 185 hectares
Heat storage system: the molten salt storage tank permits independent electrical generation for up to 15 hours without any solar feed.
The prolongation of the plant's operating time in the absence of solar radiation and the improvement in efficiency of the use of the heat from the sun makes Gemasolar's output much higher than that which is delivered by other technologies in a facility with the same power.

The notable increase in the plant's power efficiency guarantees electrical production for 6,500 hours a year, 1.5 to 3 times more than other renewable energies. The plant will thus supply clean, safe power to 25,000 homes and reduce atmospheric CO2 emissions by more than 30,000 tons a year.

The power generated by Gemasolar will be sent through a high-tension line to the substation of Villanueva del Rey (Andalusia, Spain), where it will be injected into the grid.

Plans of the Ã–sterreichische Bundesbahnen followed after 1945. In 1952, Ã–sterreichische Draukraftwerke AG (Ã–DK) carried out water and energy-related tests and created a plan for the utilisation of the Malta and GÃ¶ÃŸbÃ¤che with a three-stage power plant group. A dissertation written in 1956 at the technical university in Graz by Erich Magnet with the title ""Winter Storage Plant Inner Maltatal-Kolbnitz"" was used by Ã–sterreichische Draukraftwerke AG and proved to be very important for the development of the project.

The water rights negotiations for the Malta upper stage and Malta main stage power plants took place in 1964. The approval of the water authorities was granted in 1965. Heavy protests, especially from the Austrian Society for Nature Conservation, followed when the project area lost its nature conservation status. The conservationists called for the erection of nuclear power stations as an alternative to storage power plants. The detailed planning commenced in 1971 following the positive construction decision.

In addition to covering demand peaks, it was required that the power plant group Malta must, at all times, be in a position to provide reserve power for a failed nuclear power plant. The earlier-than-expected issuing of the building decision and the new requirements created major challenges for the planning and construction departments. In addition, the first machine unit for the main stage was to be commissioned two years earlier than expected on 1 December 1978. The planning was carried out, inter alia, by Construction Director Kurt BaustÃ¤dter, Rudolf MuÃŸnig, Kurt Landl, Heiner Ludescher and Georg Lichtenegger from Draukraftwerke AG. External planners, such as the civil technology company EhÃŸ, were also engaged. The architectural work was carried out by Rudolf Nitsch from Klagenfurt.

After a series of geological tests, the final location for Rottau power plant was fixed in 1973. The excavation pit reached a depth of approximately 30 metres below the valley basin and 25 metres below the groundwater level. Extensive safety measures were necessary to prevent the penetration of groundwater. The first machine unit was commissioned in Rottau power plant in late autumn 1976. The storage pumps were commissioned in summer 1978.

The initial planning for the power plant facilities in the Kaprun Valley date back to the ""centralisation project"" of the Allgemeine ElektricitÃ¤tsgesellschaft (AEG) Berlin [General Power Company]. The planned pooling of all the water from the Hohe Tauern into the Kaprun Valley was interrupted due to the outbreak of the global economic crisis at the beginning of the 1930's. With Austria's annexation to the German Reich in the spring of 1938, the project was once again made a high priority and re-designed under the head of the newly founded Alpen Elektrowerke AG (AEW [Alpine Power Company]), Hermann Grengg. The new plans contemplated a two stage pumped storage power plant with an upper storage reservoir on the Mooserboden and Wasserfallboden storage lakes above the Limberg Alp. The construction work began with the construction of new and expansion of existing access roads to the construction sites, in particular to the Kapruner Winkel [Kaprun Corner], the building site of the Hauptstufe [main stage] power house, and to the Limberg Alp. When the war ended, the Hauptstufe power house and a makeshift dam on the Wasserfallboden were ready for operation.

Construction of the Oberstufe [upper stage] power house could not begin, however until completion of the Limberg dam, which was to connect airside to the new structure. In the final phase of the work on the barrier, more and more attention was given to the archtectonic design of the Limberg power house. To this end, an invitation to tender was held to design of the crown of dam and powerhouse with architect Harald Bauer's design being selected. For the power house however, the third-placed architect Edith Lassmann's design was selected.

The contract was awarded at the beginning of 1951 and the excavation work for the power house to be attached to the nearly completed dam began immediately thereafter. Between May and August 1951 alone, around 10,000 mÂ³ of rock was removed from the area of the foundations for the new power house. The construction materials were transported via a tow-railway from the Bruck/Fusch station to the Kapruner Winkel and from there taken to the Limberg site with a cement cable railway.

In 1953 the construction work on the main structure was completed. Construction on the stilling basin continued until June 1954 since the final form was not set until after extensive studies and model tests had been carried out by the planning department of Tauernkraftwerke AG.

The first machine set was commissioned on 14 November 1954, the second on1 December 1955. Both of the MÃ¶ll connecting bridge pumps in the pump cave next to the Drossensperre retaining wall followed on 28 May 1956.

The barracks, equipment and auxiliary cable railway set up for the construction of the dams and power house were removed after construction was completed.",http://www.verbund.com/pp/en/pumped-storage-power-plant/kaprun-upper-stage,,,01.01.1956,,N/A,,,,,Third-Party-Owned,VERBUND Hydro Power AG,100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wolfgang Syrowatka,,+43 (0)50313-22282,,,,,Austria,22.10.2013 21:44:29,13.11.2013 20:56:32,,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 35 metre deep shaft structure of the HÃ¤usling power house consists of a freestanding reinforced concrete cylinder with an outside diameter of 32.8 metres, which is founded entirely on rock. The building has no direct anchoring to the rock of the slope behind it. Hydraulic cushioning is built into the ground floor and the first floor on the mountain side to prevent any carryover of tension - a construction method that was developed based on experience gained in the construction of the RoÃŸhag power house. The roof of the machine hall is connected to the slope by means of an anchor and gutter beam that can be walked on that can be used to channel water from the slope and roof to the drainage canal via a drop shaft.

The buildings are made of coated in situ concrete using prefabricated concrete elements in the area of the roof edges.

Since RoÃŸhag power plant is located in an avalanche-prone area, it was necessary for the entire construction to be carried out with appropriately solid material, whereby the construction elements are able to withstand a pressure of 20 to 50 t/mÂ². A total of ten deep borehole explosions had to be carried out in the excavation of the construction pit. The building is in paint-ready, in-situ concrete, supplemented by prefabricated concrete units, executed and divided into three blocks of roughly equal lengths by means of expansion joints. The roof over the machinery hall comprises prefabricated, reinforced concrete components. The uphill-facing distribution lines were embedded in a solid concrete block.

Strain was nevertheless caused by the encasing in concrete of the pumps and turbine coils, as well as the firm anchoring of the building with the rock. In the surface construction, pillars were covered with concrete at intervals of some 6 m and connected via two 8 or 15 m reinforced concrete girders that lay across the operating floor. The lower girder is connected to the rock by means of high tensile bars; the upper girder serves for slope stabilisation and simultaneously forms the uphill support for the roofing slab. The flat roofs are landscaped with vegetation. The concrete surfaces have a light-coloured interior coating; the floors of the machinery hall and the upper part of the walls are clad with red clinker slabs. The closures are designed as armoured doors.",http://www.verbund.com/pp/en/pumped-storage-power-plant/rosshag,,,01.01.1972,,N/A,,,,,Third-Party-Owned,VERBUND Hydro Power AG,100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wolfgang Syrowatka,wolfgang.syrowatka@verbund.com,+43 (0)50313-22282,,,,,Austria,22.10.2013 22:08:36,13.11.2013 20:55:48,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,

The first plans for the energy-technical utilisation of the waters at the upper end of the Malta Valley, which is known for its extremely high precipitation levels, date back to the 1930s. The decision by Ã–sterreichische Draukraftwerke AG (Ã–DK) to construct the three-stage Malta power plant, however, did not follow until 1957. The power plants comprise an upper stage with KÃ¶lnbrein reservoir and Galgenbichl power house, the main stage with Galgenbichl reservoir in the upper Malta valley between Gamskarnock and Lausnock, the main stage power house in Rottau near Kolbnitz in the MÃ¶ll valley as well as the lower stage with a diversion channel in the MÃ¶ll valley and MÃ¶llbrÃ¼cke power house in the Drau valley.

Given that it had only been established for a short time, Ã–DK did not, however, have the financial resources necessary to construct the ReiÃŸeck, Kreuzeck and Malta power plants at the same time. For this reason, detailed planning did not commence until 1961 following the completion of the ReiÃŸeck-Kreuzeck power plants. In 1965, the Malta-Upper Stage and Malta-Main Stage projects were approved by the water authorities.

The construction work for Galgenbichl power house followed after commencement of work on the KÃ¶lnbrein Dam and the Galgenbichl reservoir. The construction warehouse was extended in April 1974 and work on the development of the construction site commenced. Machinery and equipment from the neighbouring construction site at Galgenbichl Dam were used during the construction period.

The excavation work commenced in the east section of the power house, and due to the tight time schedule, continued through winter 1974/75. The work to stabilise the 40-metre cliff to the west of the power house to which parts of the building are attached proved to be a major challenge.
An external firm was commissioned to supply and prepare 800 tons of twisted ribbed steel so as to save time by working parallel. In spite of weather-related delays, work on the assembly of the first machine commenced on 1 September 1975 and the assembly of the second machine followed in 1976.

The power house was handed over to Ã–DK on 1 September 1976. The finishing work continued until spring of the following year.",http://www.verbund.com/pp/en/pumped-storage-power-plant/malta-upper-stage,,,01.01.1979,,N/A,,,,,Third-Party-Owned,VERBUND Hydro Power AG,100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Robert Zechner,robert.zechner@verbund.com,+43 (0)50313-38043,,,,,Austria,24.10.2013 00:24:28,13.11.2013 20:57:00,,,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have always relied completely on fossil fuels for power and heating, until a new system based on wind turbines, a new distributed control system and PowerStore grid-stabilizing technology was commissioned in 2009. The bases still need back-up diesel generators, but three 333 kilowatt (kW) wind turbines reduce the amount of diesel required for power generation by around 463,000 liters, and cut CO2 emissions by 1,242 metric tons per year, while lowering the risks of transporting and storing liquid fuel in this precious environment. A frequency converter interconnects the Scott and McMurdo bases, which operate at different frequencies - 50 Hz (NZ) and 60 Hz (US), allowing power flow in both directions.

The PowerStore is a compact and versatile flywheel-based grid stabilizing generator. Its main purpose is to stabilize power systems against fluctuations in frequency and voltage. It includes state-of-the-art inverters and virtual generator control software. It enables the integration of intermittent and often erratic renewable generation and the higher utilization of renewable energy generators, protecting remote communities from exposure to volatile oil prices.

PowerStore safeguards conventional microgrids, and ensures the safe integration of large amounts of wind and solar energy, reducing emissions and dependency on fossil fuels.

Ore is extracted from 1,000 meters underground with a large, electrically driven winder, which at 8.5 megawatts (MW) of demand shift over 120 seconds is a large cyclic load, given the unitâ€™s average power consumption is just 2 MW. To upgrade the winderâ€™s power supply, BHP installed a 1 MW PowerStore system, which reduced the total demand shift to 6.5 MW while adding 1 MW of spinning reserve to the system. Its flywheel-based energy storage system provides peak lopping and overcomes transient and cyclic loads on grid connected or isolated systems. The mine was able to increase winder production without affecting power system reliability.

Kruonis Pumped storage hydroelectric plant is the only hydro power plant of such type in Baltic states. After commissioning of the fourth unit in 1998, installed capacity of the plant has reached 900MW. During periods of low demand, usually at night, Kruonis PSHP is operated in pump mode, and, using cheap surplus energy, raises water from lower reservoir to upper one. With fully filled upper reservoir the plant can generate 900 MW for about 12 hours. Automatically started, the plant can reach full capacity in less than 2 min. Rapid response to demand is very important in case of emergency in the power system.

Another important feature of the plant is frequency and voltage regulation capability. Operated in synchronous condenser mode with depressed water from draft tube each unit of the plant can change output of reactive power from â€“120 MVAr to +180 MVAr.

The pumped storage power station Veytaux will play a crucial role in supplying electricity to the French-speaking part of Switzerland. The project is the response to the increasing demand for balancing energy, which has been triggered by the rapid development of the new renewable energies that generate energy in an intermittent and fluctuating manner. Thanks to its high degree of flexibility, the Veytaux power station is able to quickly balance out such fluctuations. At peak times, the water from the Hongrin reservoir is channelled through the turbines of the Veytaux power station located 800 metres lower down, while during off-peak times, the excess energy is used to pump water from Lake Geneva up to the Hongrin reservoir.

All major car manufacturers have announced to launch an electric vehicle. The Dutch market is expected to expand to 15,000-20,000 EVs in 2013, and 1,000,000 EVs in 2025. The ambition of the Dutch government is to have 200,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2020, and a continued growth to a mature market of 1 million vehicles by 2025. For scaling up the number of electric vehicles, a charging infrastructure with 500 fast charging points is essential.

However, anxiety regarding range and finding charging stations can be a major concern for EV drivers; this range anxiety can be alleviated with the availability of fast charging stations at central locations, where a car gets fully charged within 30 minutes. The availability of fast charging stations plays a major role in the acceptance by a broad group of consumers.

An important technical challenge related to electric vehicles is the effect of charging on the classic energy grid. Moreover, the classic energy grid is not suited for fast charging of EVs, as this is accompanied by very high peaks in energy demand.

All major car manufacturers have announced to launch an electric vehicle. The Dutch market is expected to expand to 15,000-20,000 EVs in 2013, and 1,000,000 EVs in 2025. The ambition of the Dutch government is to have 200,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2020, and a continued growth to a mature market of 1 million vehicles by 2025. For scaling up the number of electric vehicles, a charging infrastructure with 500 fast charging points is essential.

However, anxiety regarding range and finding charging stations can be a major concern for EV drivers; this range anxiety can be alleviated with the availability of fast charging stations at central locations, where a car gets fully charged within 30 minutes. The availability of fast charging stations plays a major role in the acceptance by a broad group of consumers.

An important technical challenge related to electric vehicles is the effect of charging on the classic energy grid. Moreover, the classic energy grid is not suited for fast charging of EVs, as this is accompanied by very high peaks in energy demand. Innovative solutions should be developed to overcome this problem.

MisterGreen aims at developing an important next step for electric transportation: sustainable fast charging stations next to Dutch highway gas stations, where electric cars get fully charged in 30 minutes using solar energy. MisterGreen aims at developing a smart-grid solution â€“ the energy needed for fast-charging is available via energy storage buffer batteries. There will be no peak energy demands on the classic energy grid as these batteries serve as energy buffer. The storage buffer batteries are charged using solar panels. A lack of available solar power can be supplemented by power from the grid.

Mistergreen will realize and manage a nationwide network of fast charging stations at the best locations in the Netherlands.

Alcatraz Island Microgrid ,Advanced Lead-acid Battery,Lead-acid Battery,Electro-chemical,400,4:45.00,Operational,Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Non-Spinning,Onsite Renewable Generation Shifting,Renewables Capacity Firming,,,,,,,,,,37.8269775,"August 29, 1899",San Francisco,California,United States,Alcatraz Island,,"The US National Park Service, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US Department of Energy and Princeton Power Systems collaborated to install a commercial scale Microgrid System on Alcatraz Island as a solution to high diesel fuel costs, pollution in the bay area, and high carbon emissions. When a shipâ€™s anchor ruptured the underwater power lines in 1950, that linked the island to San Francisco, Alcatraz was forced to turn to diesel fuel and coal as its source of power. This has led to power costs of $0.76/kWh. 

Microgrid Design: 
This project reflects the National Park Serviceâ€™s initiative to find an alternative way of powering the island in order to reduce fuel costs and pollution. A microgrid system, comprised of PPS inverters, a solar array, advanced lead-acid batteries, a PPS Site Controller, and back-up generators, was selected as a way to independently power the island. Designing and building the system on one of Californiaâ€™s and the U.S.â€™s most well-known historic landmarks with over 1 million visitors per year, created many challenges. 

Component Placement: Preserving the island in pristine condition while completing the installation was the greatest challenge. Given that a system of this size requires a large construction effort, component placement was key. To prevent the solar array from being visible from San Francisco, it was placed on the roof of the prison in a flat configuration rather than a traditional angled configuration. The inverters, battery rack, and generators were placed in the old generator room, as this space is isolated and not accessible for tourists. The room was also protected from the harsh salt water envrionment.

The whole infrastructure was assembled by Siemens Italia Spa, which won the public tender to build the microgrid. 

Since then, the campus has largely generated enough power to satisfy its own needs with the help of several networked energy producers â€“ with total capacity of 250 kW of electricity and 300 kW of heating. Three highly efficient gas microÂ­turbines supply the power, as well as the heat that is distributed across the campus via a district heating grid. An absorption chiller provides  cooling energy during summer season. In addition to the gas turbines, a concentrated solar power station with three modules based on Stirling engine technology and a photovoltaic plant with four solar cells are used to produce power. An electrochemical and two traditional boilers serve as a buffer; as needed, they balance fluctuations in the power supply caused by fluctuating producers. Two electric vehicles and two charging stations have also been added on the consumption side.

Everything is connected to the control center on the campus, which ensures smart energy management of the microgrid. The  microgrid management system monitors and manages the resources. To do so, the smart software draws on comprehensive generation and consumption forecasts and continuous realÂ­time optimization so it can respond quickly and flexibly to changing condiÂ­tions in power generation and consumption.

The sodium energy backup systems are designed to operate in extreme temperature conditions (-40Â°C to +65Â°C). Â Able to execute more than 4500 cycles at 80% DoD. No cooling required and integrated BMS. Unit: Spring 306, PV smoothing, backup power, load shifting

The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings.
The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building.
Daytime energy demand from air conditioning â€“ typically 40-50% of a buildingâ€™s electricity use during peak daytime hours â€“ can be reduced significantly.

Many of these people live in remote areas where it is not technically or economic infeasible to install an electric energy supply. A good solution is to generate the electricity locally using sustainable sources which are abundant in many of the areas in question, in order to establish a local electricity grid. Alfen recently developed the SOPRA system in order to make this possible.

SOPRA stands for Sustainable Off-grid Power Station for Rural Applications and provides for autonomous energy grids at locations where this was not previously feasible. The basic solution comprises a number of transformers, a battery pack and an advanced regulating system for the batteries, which is very mobile. The solution can therefore be used anywhere in the world. The system pays for itself within only a few years, as it replaces the expenditure on conventional energy sources such as oil and candles. Thanks to these savings in fuel costs, a SOPRA system is the ideal solution for even the poorest of countries.

The use of Lithium-ion batteries makes the SOPRA concept 10 times as compact as existing systems, so that the storage technology for approximately 10,000 users fits in a single 20 foot container. The choice for this type of battery also gives the system a long working life, while the batteries can be simply recycled.

The system works using solar energy, wind energy or water energy, but also with conventional energy sources as backup. The great advantage is that the sustainably generated energy is stored in the battery pack, rather than being lost.

This commercial scale storage system, built on Yume-shima Island, Osaka, will begin operating in February 2014. Over the next three years, the system will measure the smoothing effect of energy output fluctuation from the nearby â€œHikari-no-mori,â€ solar farm, and will aim to establish a large-scale power storage technology by safely and effectively utilizing the huge quantities of discarded used EV batteries which will become available in the future. This project has been selected as a model project for ""Verification of the battery storage control to promote renewable energy"" for the fiscal year 2013 by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan.

Sumitomo Corporation created the joint venture company, â€œ4R Energy Corporationâ€, in collaboration with Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. in September 2010, to address the secondary use of EV lithium-ion batteries. The used EV batteries that will be recycled into this large-scale storage system have been recovered and have gone through thorough inspection and maintenance at 4R, to confirm safety and performance. This prototype system (0.6MW/0.4MWh) consists of sixteen used EV batteries.

Battery Business Development Department General Manager, Norihiko Nonaka said â€œWe are pleased to be a part of such an important verification project that can both utilize used EV batteries, and provide a large-scale power storage facility, which are important issues that need to be addressed for the future of renewable energy.â€

Sumitomo will seek new business opportunities which can make use of the highly economical storage system, as well as work on developing new applications for used EV batteries. The company aims to actively promote this approach, which can both contribute to expanding the use of EV and encourage the use of renewable energy.

Erigoâ€™s contract, funded under the Department of Defense Rapid Innovation Fund and awarded by the U.S. Corp of Engineers on behalf of the U.S. Northern Command, calls for delivery of an innovative system employing multiple battery types and sophisticated control systems to address the frequency, duty cycle, and storage needs of the conventional and renewable power sources that make up many DoD microgrids.

EPTâ€™s patented PowerPyramidâ„¢ hybrid energy storage system can be tailored to quickly and smoothly compensate for load imbalances and power source interruptions. The BESS will undergo testing and evaluation at the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Energy System Integration Facility (ESIF), located on the campus of the National Renewable Energy Laboratoryâ€™s (NREL) in Golden, Colorado. At the completion of testing, NREL will assist USNORTHCOM in putting the system into service at a to-be-determined military base.

The three-tiered, 300 kW/386 kWh PowerPyramidâ„¢ grid-tied energy storage system is capable of providing grid stabilization, microgrid support and on-command power response. The hybrid  system utilizes Li-Ion, lead-acid and nickel-iron batteries to deliver an appropriate balance of rapidly available energy and total power. The system is designed to be modular so any number of additional tiers could be added to the system at a later date.

The basic solution comprises a number of transformers, a battery pack and an advanced regulating system for the batteries, which is very mobile. The solution can therefore be used anywhere in the world. The system pays for itself within only a few years, as it replaces the expenditure on conventional energy sources such as oil and candles. Thanks to these savings in fuel costs, a SOPRA system is the ideal solution for even the poorest of countries.

The use of Lithium-ion batteries makes the SOPRA concept 10 times as compact as existing systems, so that the storage technology for approximately 10,000 users fits in a single 20 foot container. The choice for this type of battery also gives the system a long working life, while the batteries can be simply recycled.

The system works using solar energy, wind energy or water energy, but also with conventional energy sources as backup. The great advantage is that the sustainably generated energy is stored in the battery pack, rather than being lost. Due to various management and communication systems being integrated in the SOPRA concept, users can pay in a number of ways, consumption can be regulated and the system can be remote controlled. Alfen supplies the SOPRA concept on a turnkey basis, including the sustainable energy generation, the energy storage, the distribution network, the management and service and maintenance.",http://www.alfen.com/en/products/text/sopra/35,26.06.2014,01.01.2015,,,N/A,,Cooperative (Customer Owned),,,Customer-Owned,Confidential,100,,,Valence Technology,ALFEN,ALFEN,ALFEN,ALFEN,,,,,20,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Evert Raaijen,e.raaijen@alfen.com,,,,,,,10.07.2014 18:02:55,12.08.2014 19:18:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,

The generation for the high penetration hybrid microgrid system is provided by a 225kW Vestas V27 wind turbine, and two 150kW Volvo diesel generators, along with smart switch technology and a synchronizing condenser. Originally commissioned in 1999, the plant supplies electricity and heat to an industrial/airport facility, and has reduced the cost of electricity and heat to 40% of the original diesel based generation cost. 

Beaconâ€™s technology will enable TDX to further improve wind utilization, delivering projected fuel savings of up to 30 percent over existing (pre flywheel) consumption levels.

Ice Energy was one of 3 providers selected in the behind-the-meter energy storage category, which was part of an energy storage procurement by SCE that was significantly larger than the minimum mandated by the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC).

The contract resulted from an open and competitive process under SCEâ€™s Local Capacity Requirements (LCR) RFO. The goals of the LCR RFO and Californiaâ€™s Storage Act Mandates are to optimize grid reliability, support renewables integration to meet the 2020 portfolio standards, and support the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 20% of 1990 levels by 2050.

Ice Energyâ€™s product, the Ice Bear, attaches to one or more standard 5-20 ton commercial AC units. The Ice Bear freezes ice at night when demand for power is low, capacity is abundant and increasingly sourced from renewables such as wind power. Then during the day, stored ice is used to provide cooling, instead of the power-intensive AC compressor. Ice Bears are deployed in smart-grid enabled, megawatt-scale fleets, and each Ice Bear can reduce harmful CO2 emissions by up to 10 tons per year. Installation is as quick as deploying a standard AC system.",http://www.ice-energy.com/ice-energy-awarded-25-6-megawatts-contracts-southern-california-edison-behind-meter-thermal-energy-storage/,05.11.2014,,,,CAISO,Southern California Edison,Investor Owned,,,Third-Party-Owned,Ice Energy,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tracy Williams,tracy@olmsteadwilliams.com,(310) 824-9000,,,,,,11.03.2015 18:46:36,12.03.2015 02:46:35,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,

The multi stage (or hybrid) energy storage system consists of a fast-response, high-cycle, short-duration Beacon flywheel energy storage system (FESS) and a lower cycle life, longer duration battery energy storage system (BESS).  

The FESS provides first stage response to any grid instabilities (i.e. frequency and ramp rate control) while the BESS is a second stage response if more energy is needed, to assist in avoiding resource curtailment, andto improve the predictability of output.  Combining the two technologies has the added benefit of significantly increasing the life of the BESS by reducing its cycle duty while the FESS manages rapid response cycling.

The pumped storage project, located upstream on the Naktong river in the province of Kyongsangbukdo, approximately 314 km southeast of Seoul, will help to support the economic growth of this mountainous region near Juwang National Park that is home to approximately 34,000 people.

Civil work for the US$304.8M scheme, financed by Korea Western Power, is being carried out by a consortium of Donga Construction Company and Samsung Engineering & Construction Company, both Korean companies. Hyundai Engineering is serving as project consultant. The facility is expected to begin generating electricity by the end of 2006.

In the first open, international competitive bidding for a hydro power project in South Korea, following the country's entry into the World Trade Organization, Korea Western Power awarded the contract for the project's equipment supply to GE-hydro in January 2002.

GE will supply, install and commission two 300 MW reversible pump turbines, 333 MVA motor/generators, governors, exciters and balance of plant equipment. Pumping operations will be performed in off-peak periods using relatively low cost power from other generation sources. The motor/generators are each rated at 333/339.8 MVA at 18 kV, 0.9/0.95 power factor and 300 rpm. Output of the pump turbine is 306 MW at a net head of 307.9 m. Maximum pump output is 31 MW. Each unit has a specified allowable duration to change operational modes, from standstill, pump, generate, generate-condense and pump condense.

GE Energy in Norway, part of GE Hydro, will provide the project management, conceptual design and turbine runners for the project. Generators will be designed and supplied through GE Canada and other sub-suppliers, while ABB Canada will supply the control equipment, static starters and exciters. Shipping of equipment for the project will begin in April 2004.

The plant will be connected to the local power grid via a new, 20 km, two-circuit transmission line connected to the 345 kV bus of the Shinyoungil substation.

Interesting fact: The plant's two 300-MW pump-turbines are operated remotely from the 600-MW Samrangjin Pumped-Storage project 130 kilometers away.

Opened by the Queen in October 1965, it is one of four pumped storage power schemes in the UK, and has the distinction of being the world's first high head reversible pumped-storage hydro scheme. The station has also been used as the setting for several films, including the James Bond film The World is not Enough.

Nicknamed The Hollow Mountain, Cruachan was constructed between 1959 and 1954 and is unique in that the station is concealed within the hollowed out rock of Ben Cruachan, 3,694 feet (1,126 m), which overlooks the visitor centre. It was conceived and designed by Sir Edward MacColl, a Scottish engineer and a pioneer of hydro electricity in Scotland, with numerous projects to his credit. The only visible features are the dam, which is 1,000 feet (316 m) wide and located 1,300 feet (390 m) up the mountain, and the station offices and visitor centre, which lie on the loch side below the dam, and next to the road.

Buried in the mountain and accessed by a tunnel 23 feet (7 m) wide and 13 feet (4 m) high, the main cavern houses four motor-generator sets capable of generating a total output of 440 MW. Construction of the main cavern, similar in size to a football pitch, required the excavation of 220,000 cubic metres of rock and soil.

The station can operate for 22 hours before the supply of water in the reservoir is exhausted, and is required to maintain a 12 hour emergency supply in reserve. Figures given for the Foyers scheme show that the system can raise 167 tonnes of water (167 cubic metres) per second when pumping at full power, with the flow rate increasing to 200 tonnes per second when generating at full power.",http://www.spenergywholesale.com/pages/cruachan_power_station.asp,,,15.10.1965,,N/A,Scottish Power,,Transmission,,Third-Party-Owned,Scottish Power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1866 822 168 ,,Lochawe ,Dalmally ,,United Kingdom,26.07.2013 16:32:58,06.12.2013 21:04:28,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sumba Island is home to over 600,000 people and is one of the Lesser Sunda Islands, and is in the province of East Nusa Tenggara. 

The VRB ESS will provide real and reactive power to Sumba, a small island in eastern Indonesia that has poor power supply. Using the ESS, the grid can support power to the island when the main grid is interrupted. This will in turn generate a smooth output of power, increasing the renewable accommodation capability. The PCS100 ESS battery solution can help energy storage devices, such as batteries,  achieve stable storage and release of electrical energy 
through frequency modulation and voltage regulation. For a power system, PCS100 ESS is just like a conventional synchronous generator featuring power electronics and advanced control technologies. Its inertial characteristics depend on the internal control system, which is aligned to the grid frequency and its change, and energy conversion is recognized on this basis.

DemandLogic will allow the district schools to reduce energy costs by using stored electricity to lower peak demand. 

SolarCity will install the district's solar systems and advanced battery technology at eight elementary and middle schools, as well as additional solar generation at a district office. The solar installations will total more than 1.4 megawatts of clean power capacity, with storage providing an additional 360 kilowatts (720 kilowatt hours) of power to reduce peak demand. The new solar systems are expected to save the district more than $1 million dollars over the life of the contracts, and the DemandLogic battery storage systems could save thousands more on demand charges each year. 

Burton School District retained TerraVerde Renewable Partners, an independent energy advisor, to assess and scope an optimal energy cost savings program, analyze financing options, organize the RFP process and help the district select the best candidate to meet the program's specifications. 

The new SolarCity systems are expected to generate 2.3 million kilowatt hours of solar energy annually, and enough over the life of the contract to power more than 4,000 homes for a year. The solar systems will also help avoid more than 43 million pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere and save more than 203 million gallons of water*, an especially important environmental benefit in the drought-stricken valley.

The plant, which is on the Tennessee River about 6 miles west of Chattanooga, has four pump/turbine units that together would cover a football field.

Deep below the lake's surface, hundreds of feet below the mountaintop, is the powerhouse. At times of low power demand, giant turbines pump water up to the reservoir at a rate of seven million gallons per minute. This huge energy storage facility gives TVA much of the flexibility it needs to balance supply and demand on its extensive system.

In between the two plants is a forebay capable of holding about 740 million gallons of water; behind the Lewiston plant, a 1,900-acre, 22 billion gallon reservoir holds additional supplies of this liquid fuel.

Water is diverted from the Niagara Riverâ€”up to 375,000 gallons a secondâ€”and conveyed through conduits under the City of Niagara Falls to Lewiston. From there, water flowing through the Robert Moses plant spins turbines that power generators, converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy.

At night, when electricity demand is low, the Lewiston units operate as pumps, transporting water from the forebay up to the plant's reservoir.

During the daytime, when electricity use peaks, the Lewiston pumps are reversed and become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant. In this way, the water can be used to produce electricity twice, increasing production and efficiency.

To balance the need for power with a desire to preserve the beauty of Niagara Falls, the United States and Canada signed a treaty in 1950 that regulates the amount of water diverted for hydroelectricity production. On average, more than 200,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), or 1.5 million gallons of water a second, flow from Lake Erie into the Niagara River. The 1950 pact requires that at least 100,000 cfs of water spill over the Falls during the daylight hours in the tourist season, April through October. This flow may be cut in half at night during this period and at all times the rest of the year.",http://www.nypa.gov/facilities/niagara.htm,,18.03.1957,28.01.1961,,NYISO,New York Power Authority (NYPA),Public Owned,Transmission,,Utility-Owned,New York Power Authority (NYPA),100,,,Hitachi,,,,,Ferguson Electric,,,,,Performance metrics not available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Michael Mitchell,mitchell.m@nypa.gov,914-681-6428,,,,,,19.04.2013 19:36:01,09.07.2014 20:26:07,,,TRUE,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dam was built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to regulate the Allegheny River as part of a larger flood control project, and, as a secondary role, to generate hydroelectric power. It created the Allegheny Reservoir, a lake that stretches 25 miles (40 km) upriver.

The power plant, rated at 435 MW, was built by the Pennsylvania Electric Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. It began commercial operation in 1970. Through business mergers and acquisitions, the plant is now owned by FirstEnergy, an operator of several base load (nuclear and coal-fired) power plants. Pumped storage plants function similarly to a storage battery; they absorb excess power generated by such plants in off-peak hours, such as nighttime, using it to pump water into a reservoir. Later, when demand exceeds the base load, the flow of water from the reservoir generates additional electrical power to meet peak load demands.","https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CC4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fasiapacificpartnership.org%2Fpdf%2FPGTTF%2Fevents-august-07%2FOverview%2520of%2520FirstEnergy%2520Pumped%2520Hydro%2520Seneca%2520%26%2520Yards%2520Creek%2520Stations.ppt&ei=7bF5UfS9JsqpigL394CQBQ&usg=AFQjCNHadq1aGUTQtPN5nCg66Hr3K59f3w&sig2=snbjY_iytTlge7KRuDM0CA&bvm=bv.45645796,d.cGE",,,,,PJM,,,,,Third-Party-Owned,LS Power Group,100,,,,,,,Pennsylvania Electric Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company,,,,,,"Mean Annual Gross Energy Generation (2004-2009): 691,816 MWh; Mean Annual Net Energy Generation (2004-2009): -243,372 MWh",61000000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23.04.2013 17:45:07,16.07.2014 20:16:15,,,TRUE,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is owned and operated by the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA). Its construction was in response to growing power demands and a lack of dam sites on the Grand River. The first phase was completed in 1968 and the second in 1971. The upper reservoir for the power station is Lake W. R. Holway which was built on Saline Creek and the lower reservoir is Lake Hudson on the Grand River. During periods of lower power demand, water is pumped from Lake Hudson to Lake Holway and released back down through the pump-generators during periods of high energy demand.

The project was constructed in two stages:

Stage 1 consisted of building an earth and rock filled dam in Chimney Rock Hollow 185 feet (56 m) high, creating Chimney Rock Reservoir. A canal 1,850 feet (560 m) long led from the dam to a forebay structure that had openings for steel penstocks,each 14 feet (4.3 m) in diameter. Three penstocks led from the forebay to a powerhouse that housed three 64,000 horsepower pump-generators, with a total rated capacity of 130 megawatts. This stage was completed in 1968.

Stage 2 comprised building three more penstocks, extending the powerhouse and adding three more pump-generators, all identical to those installed in Stage 1. This doubled the facility's capacity to 260 mw. It was completed in 1971.

The Generation Cycle begins at Llyn Stwlan - Ffestiniog's upper reservoir. Large screens inside the intake towers are opened to activate the high-pressure downflow.

27 cubic metres of water per second are discharged through two high-pressure shafts (each 200 metres in depth), which are connected to four concrete-lined tunnels. Steel penstocks then direct the discharge into the station via inlet pipes and valves to start generation.

Water is captured in Tan-y-Grisiau and pumped back to Llyn Stwlan, usually overnight, to complete the cycle.

It is located 18 km (11 mi) east of KÅshÅ« in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan.

When energy demand is high, water from the upper reservoir is released down to the underground power station via a single 3.3 km (2 mi) long headrace tunnel which splits into two 1.8 km (1 mi) tunnels before each separate into two 620 m (2,034 ft) long penstocks. Each penstock feeds a single reversible 400 MW Francis turbine-generator with water before it is released into a 3.3 km (2 mi) long tailrace tunnel which discharges into the lower reservoir, created by the Kazunogawa Dam. When energy demand is low and therefore inexpensive, the turbines reverse into pumps and send water from the lower reservoir back to the upper reservoir. The process is repeated when necessary to help balance electricity loads. The difference in elevation between the upper and lower reservoirs affords an effective hydraulic head of 714 m (2,343 ft) and maximum of 779 m (2,556 ft).

There are currently two expansion projects that are taking place including listed separately as Kazunogawa (No.3) Pump Expansion and Kazunogawa (No.4) Pump Expansion.

The scheme was redeveloped to focus on pumped-storage in 1969, having been purchased by the Hydro Board from the British Aluminium Company (BAC). The scheme was originally built by BAC in 1896 and was the first large-scale commercial hydro-electric scheme in the UK, used to power an aluminium smelter also located here until this closed in 1967. BAC created a reservoir by joining two small lochs to form Loch Mhor, which lies 179 m above Loch Ness and 2 miles away.

During the redevelopment, a 5 MW turbine was installed in the original power station building to replace the original plant and provide pure hydro-electric generation, while the tunnels and pipes which carried the water were reused. The River Fechlin was diverted into Loch Mhor to provide additional water and, to support the pumped-storage system, new tunnels and a further power station were built.

A new power station was built to house two 150 MW Francis generation-motor sets, each weighing 914 tonnes, with 5 m wide turbine blades. 100 cubic meters of water pass through each turbine and out into the loch every second during generation. The turbines can be brought from a standstill to full power output in less than two minutes, which makes the station extremely responsive to demand. The new scheme became fully operational in 1975.

The scheme has a total capacity of 305 MW and is run by Scottish & Southern Energy Plc.

Realizing the crucial importance of peaking assistance to the grid, Tata Power had installed a pumped storage unit as an extension to the existing Bhira hydro power station. The Bhira pumped storage unit is the single largest such unit in India and is perhaps the only pumped storage unit operating in both pumping and generation mode in India at the time of its commissioning.

The plant is a member of the Jansen Power Plant Group, which utilizes the waters of the Pfreimd and includes two other hydroelectric power plants, Reisach and Trausnitz.

TanzmÃ¼hle is connected via tunnel to two elevated reservoirs, the off-stream Rabenleite Reservoir and the KainzmÃ¼hl Reservoir, which is created by a dam upstream on the Pfreimd. This allows TanzmÃ¼hle to draw water from one reservoir to generate electricity and pump it up to the other reservoir for storage.  The plant's traditional hydroelectric component draws running water from the Pfreimd and releases it back into the river. It may later be pumped up to the Rabenleite Reservoir by Reisach Power Plant or used to generate electricity by the traditional hydroelectric plant, Trausnitz.

It draws its energy from the force of the tide by using a tidal barrage. Instead of damming water on one side like a conventional dam, a tidal barrage first allows water to flow into a bay or river during high tide, and releasing the water back during low tide. This is done by measuring the tidal flow and controlling the sluice gates at key times of the tidal cycle. Turbines are then placed at these sluices to capture the energy as the water flows in and out.

The station's 24 reversible bulb pump-turbines are used to pump water into the river basin at high tide (for ebb generation). This energy is more than returned during generation, because power output is strongly related to the head. If water is raised 2 ft (61 cm) by pumping on a high tide of 10 ft (3 m), this will have been raised by 12 ft (3.7 m) at low tide. The cost of a 2 ft rise is returned by the benefits of a 12 ft rise.

It is a construction with daily water accumulation that participates in the functioning of the frequency regulation and of the distribution of electricity to the grid. This hydraulic structure consists of four parts: an upper and a lower reservoir, penstocks and a power station. The lower reservoir was created by means of damming up the valley of the ÄŒierny VÃ¡h by a 375 m long dam. Its capacity is 5.1 million m3. The level fluctuates by 7.45 m between elevations 726.00 â€“ 733.45 m. The upper reservoir of an irregular shape is situated between the valleys of the Biely VÃ¡h and the ÄŒierny VÃ¡h. It has a maximum capacity of 3.7 million m3 of water and the level fluctuates by 25 m between the elevation points 1160 â€“ 1135 m above sea level. The sealing of the slopes and of the bottom is provided by one layer of asphalt concrete sealing blanket with a surface of approximately 200,000 m2. Underneath the reservoir, there is an inspection tunnel that should collect the potential seepages from the reservoir bottom and slopes. The hydraulic connection of the upper and lower reservoir is ensured via three pressure penstocks which have an internal diameter of 3.8 m. In the valley, they split into pipes that transport the water to the two turbines and outlets of water from the two accumulation pumps. The maximum head between the upper and the lower reservoirs is 434 m. The lower reservoir dam includes also a power station with a control room. There are six pumping turbo aggregates installed that comprise a motor generator, a Francis turbine and an accumulation pump. When 6 accumulation pumps are in operation, it takes 8 hours to pump the water into the upper reservoir.

In 2005, Sumitomo Electric International (Osaka, Japan) was contracted to install a vanadium flow battery system at the existing 30.6 MW Tomamae Wind Villa on the island of Hokkaido, Japan.  The primary intent of the battery system is to provide â€œwind smoothingâ€ for the intermittent and variable wind plant.  The facility has operated well since 5 January 2005, sometimes performing over 50 charge-discharge cycles per hour. By acting as a rapid source and sink for the sometimes highly variable wind energy production, this facility has reduced the ramping rates of the wind farmâ€™s output with respect to the rest of the islandâ€™s grid by reducing the peaks and valleys of the wind farm energy output. 

The project is located on a Tomamae Town managed stock farm.  Scenery and farm land utilization is preserved by burying the power cables and installing transformers in the turbine towers. The energy storage facility is configured with 16 modules rated at 250 kW each, which gives the entire facility 4 MW with 6 MWh of storage (90 minutes).  Pulse power of 6 MW exists, but only for 20 minutes.  The project was developed and is owned by J-Power, the largest electric utility in Japan. While moving into wind generation, J-Power produces most of itâ€™s electricity from coal-fired and hydroelectric power plants.

Three pillars of Smart Grids in distribution systems
The project Web2Energy is directed to implement and approve all three pillars of ""Smart Distribution"".

1. Smart Metering â€“ the consumer participates in the energy market
A few hundred electricity consumers in the supply area of HSE AG will be obtained with smart meters. These advanced meters provide many innovative functions:

Remote reading of metered values in short term intervals,
Reception and visualization of price signals (variable rates)
Disturbance signals and management of failures
Estimation of manipulations and stolen energy
Permanent meter data storage and monitoring of load profiles
Supervision and control of distributed power producer, storage and controllable loads
Furthermore, they provide gateways to monitor the current demand with the related costs and to further functions of building automation and in-house energy management (smart home). Variable (up to hourly) rates are offered to the clients. Current rates, the rate forecasts and the current demand are monitored. The consumer gets the opportunity to control his demand regarding non time critical loads in accordance with the offered rates. The project Web2Energy is able to achieve experiences with such a practice. The advanced meter technology comes from Landis + Gyr Austria.

2. Smart  Energy Management â€“ Clustering of small power producers 
A large number of small independent power producers are supervised and coordinated in such a way that at each moment a scheduled power feeds into the distribution network in accordance with the current demand or the request from the market. Consequently, the deviation of fluctuating wind or solar power from the predictions can be compensated in real-time through the aggregation with controllable generators, loads and storage in the framework of a virtual power plant (VPP). Inside the supply area of the HSE AG this coordination will be applied with benefits. Parallel with a number of volatile of wind power and photovoltaic plants a large number controllable hydro and thermo power plants with cogeneration of heat and power (CHP), storage and controllable industrial loads are in operation. They are able to contribute to the generation and load management. The central operated VPP participates on the markets for energy and control power and optimizes the operations and the overall power in-feed. In this way all participants can achieve higher efficiency and higher compensation of their expenses in comparison with the single market access. To support the VPP operations advanced storage technologies will be established. The EUS GmbH Dortmund implements the VPP procedures. The Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) contributes its experience of market access.

3. Smart Distribution Automation â€“ higher reliability of supply
Today supply interruptions happen very rarely. When they do occur, they are caused by 96% in the medium (MV)-/low (LV) voltage distribution networks. In the case of a disturbance an inspection team has to drive along the MV/LV-terminals for disturbance allocation and supply recovery by switching operations. These procedures take on average 1 hour or more. The Web2Energy project implements an automated sequence to execute the former manual processes in a selected area of the HSE AG. This approach cuts the supply interruption down to minutes. Consequently, the very high reliability of supply in Germany will be significantly improved. The necessary control technology comes from iPLS (PL).

Linking the users: All three pillars of smart distribution require the information exchange between the users of the network like consumers, producers, terminals, control centre of the network operator, traders and VPP.  Communication channels have to cover also the last meters to these participants.",http://www.web2energy.com,,,,,N/A,HSE AG,,,,Third-Party-Owned,European Union,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Federal/National,,,,,,,,,,,,,contact@web2energy.com,,,,,,,10.09.2013 20:31:36,05.06.2014 17:44:30,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SYSLAB consists of two wind turbines, a pv-array, a diesel genset, different types of 
load and an office building with intelligent load control. SYSLAB also includes a distributed control system. 

The tests on the vanadium battery will include specific tests on the battery alone such as 
response tests, efficiency tests at different levels of SOC etc. and tests and measurements while it provides different services to grid including smoothing of wind turbine output, load balancing and similar services. A key point for the investigations is comparison 
between laboratory test performance and performance during normal operation.

Coral Bay PowerStore Flywheel Project,Flywheel,Flywheel,Electro-mechanical,500,0:0.60,Operational,Frequency Regulation,Voltage Support,,,,,,,,,,,-23.1410266,113.7764051,Coral Bay,Western Australia,Australia,,,"Coral Bay is the gateway to the Ningaloo Reef World Heritage Area in Northwestern Australia, where power demand increases significantly during the tourist season. A PowerStore grid-stabilizing system and DCS power management solution oversees the townâ€™s power supply, which consists of seven 320 kilowatt (kW) low-load diesel generation units combined with three 200 kW wind turbines. PowerStoreâ€™s 500 kW flywheel technology enables the wind turbines to supply up to 95 percent of Coral Bayâ€™s energy supply at times, with a total annual wind penetration of 45 percent, while maintaining city grid standards of power stability and quality. Power station data indicates more than 80 percent of Coral Bayâ€™s power is wind generated for one-third of the year. The data also shows that for nearly 900 hours per year, wind provides more than 90 percent of Coral Bayâ€™s power supply. PowerStore maximizes an environmentally friendly solution.

The PowerStore is a compact and versatile flywheel-based grid stabilizing generator. Its main purpose is to stabilize power systems against fluctuations in frequency and voltage. It includes state-of-the-art inverters and virtual generator control software. It enables the integration of intermittent and often erratic renewable generation and the higher utilization of renewable energy generators, protecting remote communities from exposure to volatile oil prices.

PowerStore safeguards conventional microgrids, and ensures the safe integration of large amounts of wind and solar energy, reducing emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. High-speed software controls the power flow into and out of the flywheel, essentially making it a high inertia electrical shock absorber that can instantly smooth out power fluctuations generated by wind turbines or solar arrays.

PowerStore acts like a STATCOM (advanced grid technology that quickly stabilizes voltage and improves power quality) and in addition is capable of rapidly absorbing or injecting real power within an isolated power network. It can stabilize both voltage and frequency, hold 18 MWs (megawatt seconds) of energy and shift from full absorption to full injection in 1 millisecond to stabilize the grid.

When the sun is shining, PowerStore grid-stabilizing technology and DCS power management solution ensures maximum solar energy (100% peak penetration) goes into the network by lowering diesel generation, up to the minimum loading of the generation units. When the sun is obscured, the PowerStore covers the loss of solar power generation as the DCS ramps up the diesel generation, so the network has an uninterrupted energy supply. The solar energy systems generate over 1 gigawatt hour (GWh) of renewable energy per year, supplying 60 percent of the average daytime energy for both towns, saving 405,000 liters of fuel and 1,100 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year.

It is located 14 km (9 mi) north of Numata. It creates the upper reservoir for the 1,200 MW Tamahara Pumped Storage Power Station (çŽ‰åŽŸç™ºé›»æ‰€). Construction began in 1973 and the dam was complete in 1981 while the power station was commissioned in 1986. It is 116 m (381 ft) tall and withholds a reservoir with a storage capacity of 14,800,000 m3 (11,999 acreÂ·ft). Of that capacity, 13,000,000 m3 (10,539 acreÂ·ft) is active (or useful) for power generation. The lower reservoir for the pumped-storage power station is created by the Fujiwara Dam, located 4 km (2 mi) to the northwest on another Tone River tributary. Power is generated during periods of high energy demand and pumping occurs during times when energy demand is low such as at night. The power station contains four 300 MW reversible Francis turbine pump-generators which serve to both pump water and generate electricity. The upper Tamahara Reservoir is at an elevation of 1,177 m (3,862 ft) and the lower Fujiwara Reservoir is at 651 m (2,136 ft) which affords the power station an effective hydraulic head of 518 m (1,699 ft). When pumping, the pump-generators can move up to 210 m3/s (7,416 cu ft/s) of water and when generating, they discharge up to 276 m3/s (9,747 cu ft/s).

The dam's power plant contains 2 x 211 MW pumped-storage generators than can generate power in the normal way by allowing water to flow through its turbines. However, during periods when the demand for electricity is low (such as evenings, weekends, or during seasonal fluctuations), the dam can use its excess power generating capacity to pump water back into the reservoirâ€”enhancing reservoir capacity and storing water for periods when the demand for electricity is high. At the time it was constructed, the AldeadÃ¡vila Dam had the largest pumping station in Europe. 

The AldeadÃ¡vila Dam has two diversion tunnels, each 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) in length. Each tunnel has a 53-metre (174 ft) high surge tank. The dam also contains more than 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) of tunnels which divert water to the electrical generation turbines. There are six penstock tunnels, each about 5 metres (16 ft) in diameter. The design of the penstocks and auxiliary spillways using these tunnels has proved to be an issue, however. Cavitation problems have damaged these tunnels in the past. Until the Alcantara Dam was built in 1969, the AldeadÃ¡vila Dam was the largest hydroelectric power plant in Europe. As of 2010, it remains the largest in Spain. The dam's hydroelectric power station originally housed six 170,000 horsepower (130,000 kW) Francis turbines which generated 718 MW, about half that of Hoover Dam.In 1987, the AldeadÃ¡vila II power station extension was completed, boosting generating capacity by 400 MW.

A fall of 830 metres was achieved using some of the most advanced engineering techniques available at that time. A six  kilometre tunnel was drilled under a ridge to the northern edge of the Great Western Tiers. From here the water flows down a large high-pressure steel penstock and vertical shaft into Tasmaniaâ€™s first underground power station at Poatin.

The Poatina Power Station is a huge underground excavation, as wide as a city street, as long as a city block and as high as a seven story building. It houses six 50 MW generators and is the Stateâ€™s second largest power station.

While operating with the generator, it is practically a hydro power plant with all relevant advantages-characteristics. While operating with pumps, it has a very rigid characteristics. The level of use of pump-turbine is 0.73, which defines this plant as a consumer. Water inflow in the upper storage reservoir is insignificant in comparison with the pumped quantities of water. These reasons cause a rational use of the plant in terms of its maximum engagement in operating with generator within the shortest possible time.

The fusion equipment (COMPASS-D tokamak) was previously used in UKAEA, United Kingdom. The equipment required electrical input power of 50 MW for pulse duration for about 2-3 seconds during operation. Such power was accessible in Culham Laboratory directly from the 33kV grid. 

However, only 1 MW power is available from the 22kV grid at the campus of the Academy of Sciences in Prague, where IPP Prague is located. Therefore, several solutions to provide the necessary input power were considered. Installation of two flywheel generators was chosen as a solution. They provide the necessary power (70 MW, 100 MJ) as well as a reasonable redundancy in case of flywheel system failure.

This new form of pumped hydro storage system is based on an underground 
storage reservoir, where the water is enclosed in a membrane with up to 25 meters of soil on top.

The overlaying soil gives the necessary pressure to run a pump/turbine and store large amount of electrical energy, corresponding to the pressure created by the level difference in the well-known pumped storage system.

The demonstration plant measures 50 x 50 meters and the average pumping head is 1 meter. Thus, it contains a total of 2 500 m3 water. The plant is covered by a 3-meter soil layer.

Given the chosen dimensions, the membrane can store 34 kWh. It may not sound like much, but if the energy membrane is scaled by a factor 10 in all three dimensions, the stored amount of energy will reach 200 MWh which equals 8 hours of energy consumption by 50 000 single-family houses.

The purpose of the demonstration plant is to test the geotechnical conditions and to prepare a mathematical model for the pumped storage. Furthermore, the project is to uncover the challenges and possibilities in storing energy in an underground pumped storage, in both environmental and technical as well as in economic terms.

The next step â€“ a pilot plant sized 200 x 200 meters â€“ will be based on the experiences from this demonstration plant.

The dam's spillway is controlled by seven radial gates, which, along with four regulating conduits at the bottom of the dam, give the dam a total maximum discharge of 112,000 cubic feet per second (3,200 m3/s). Hiwassee Lake stretches along the river for approximately 22 miles (35 km) to the town of Murphy, North Carolina, and has 180 miles (290 km) of shoreline, a storage capacity of 434,000 acreÂ·ft (535,000 dam3) and 205,590 acreÂ·ft (253,590 dam3) of flood storage. The reservoir's operating level varies by roughly 38 feet (12 m) in a typical year.

During the 1950s, TVA experimented with the idea of ""pumped storage"" at Hiwassee Dam. There it employed an energy-generating turbine that was run in reverse during low-demand hours to pump water below the dam into the upper reservoir. This integration of pump and turbine was the first of its kind in the United States; further, at the time it was the largest and most powerful in the world. The unit was built by Allis-Chalmers Company. The ""pump-turbine"" at Hiwassee is designated a ""National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark"" by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)

The reservoir LÃ¤ngental, often referred to as cache LÃ¤ngental, is located 400 meters below Finstertal reservoir and acts as intermediate storage with 1/20th of Finstertal's storage capacity. There are 13 mountain streams that continuously supply the reservoir. Water can either be pumped back into the Finstertal reservoir via the KÃ¼htai Pumped Hydro Station or the water can flow down stream for electricity production via the Silz power station.

The Silz power plant sits at an altitude of 643 meters above sea level. The power plant contains two Silz Pelton Pelton turbines wich rotate at 500 revolutions per minute.

Using a Francis design, the turbines are capable of electrical production and can also be used for pumped storage, where a reservoir is filled by the turbine (acting as a pump) driven by the generator acting as a large electrical motor during periods of low power demand, and then reversed and used to generate power during peak demand. These pump storage reservoirs, etc. act as large energy storage sources to store ""excess"" electrical energy in the form of water in elevated reservoirs. This is one of only a few ways that temporary excess electrical capacity can be stored for later utilization.

Hydroelectric power plants can quickly be adjusted, and this makes hydroelectricity ideal for the role of compensating for potential shortfalls to meet peak demand. Pumped storage hydroelectric power plants, which pump in water during low-demand evening hours and use it to generate power during peak hours, have become the mainstream of hydroelectric power generation in recent years in Japan.

In August, 2013, ZeroBase revealed plans to install microgrid hybrid technology in partnership with Princeton Power Systems, with the intent of managing and updating existing generators, energy storage systems, and solar installations in and around Lokichogio, Kenya.

A hub of humanitarian efforts in eastern Africa, Lokichogio (or simply Loki, as it is often called) hosts United Nations offices, a hospital run by the International Committee of the Red Cross, and approximately fifty NGOs. Given the regionâ€™s rural location near the border of south Sudan, its incorporated NGOs, and the surrounding communities are often reliant on generators for electrical power. Aiming to provide solutions to Lokiâ€™s power concerns, ZeroBase was recently awarded a contract to supply hybridized microgrid generation and storage systems for a one-hundred-kilowatt installation in the region, utilizing Princeton Power Systemsâ€™ Microgrid technology.

Princeton Power Systems (www.princetonpower.com) is a New Jersey-based designer and manufacturer of products for energy storage, conversion, and management. Princeton Power Systems shares ZeroBaseâ€™s goal of enabling safe and sustainable energy use through the development of practical technology. While the customer currently has diesel generators, the project will incorporate adding PV, lead acid batteries, and a generator to the Micro-grid system.

Clearwater Industries, Ltd. is also working with ZeroBase in the Lokichogo region. Operating out of Nairobi, Clearwater Industries is a renewable energy company involved in the development, marketing, and distribution of hybrid energy solutions. As a conduit for ZeroBaseâ€™s pursuits in Kenya, Clearwater will be offering ZeroBaseâ€™s proprietary ReGenerator systems for installation throughout the region. Clearwater is also aiming to provide water filtration in the form of ZeroBaseâ€™s UF2500 units: portable ultrafiltration systems capable of purifying over two thousand gallons of water per day. Clearwater has also acquired an H-Series Hybrid power system from ZeroBase, as well as the water filtration systems, for testing and demonstration purposes.",http://www.thezerobase.com/zerobase-partners-with-princeton-power-to-develop-microgrid-tech-in-kenya,01.08.2013,,,,N/A,,,,,Utility-Owned,Confidential,,,,,Princeton Power Systems,Princeton Power Systems,,,,,,,,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Jaron Rothkop,jrothkop@thezerobase.com,+1 (888) 530-9376,160 Vester Street,Ferndale,MI,48220,United States,29.01.2014 00:23:40,25.06.2014 16:37:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,

The new technology allows to maintain momentary power balance more efficiently.

KPX said the new technology will provide benefits of improving operation of electric power systems and creating new businesses as it allows thermal power plants to reduce cost factors in regulating frequency.

And, it will enable power generation companies to minimize high-cost LNG-fired power generation by increasing use of low-cost power generation, while avoiding construction of additional power plants needed for securing power reserves. It will also reduce emission of pollutant (yellow plume) and allow companies to reduce consumption of high-priced batteries thanks to ESS-based short cycle service.

Moreover, it will enable low cost power plant, which is in output cutback operation to regulate frequency, to conduct fixed output operation by 100% by storing power of electric power systems in ESSs when frequency rises and discharging stored power when frequency drops. It is analyzed that companies will be able to drastically reduce power generation costs in this way.

In conjunction with 10 companies, including Hyosung, SK Innovation, LG Chem, LSIS, KPX plans to carry forward the project of developing technologies and systems needed for introducing ESS-based frequency regulation service (project title: Development of ESS operating system for regulating frequency of electric power systems and electric power market system) for three years(2013~2016), investing a total of 21.5 billion won (10 billion won by the government and 11.5 billion won by private sector).",http://energy.korea.com/archives/56339,,,,,N/A,,,,,Customer-Owned,Korea Power Exchange (KPX),,,,SK Innovation,Hyosung Corporation,Hyosung Corporation,,,,,,,,Performance metrics not available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27.03.2014 05:03:05,06.08.2014 19:09:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,

GM E-Motor Charging Station & Microgrid,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Electro-chemical,30,1:0.00,Operational,Frequency Regulation,Transportation Services,,,,,,,,,,,39.3794196,-76.4599043,White Marsh,Maryland,United States,,21162,"General Motors, OnStar and TimberRock Energy Solutions have collaborated to deploy an advanced, solar microgrid at GMâ€™s E-Motor Plant in White Marsh, Maryland. The objective of the project was to quantify how a microgrid comprised of distributed energy resources (DERs) that include solar PV, EV charging infrastructure, stationary li-ion energy storage and a ï¬‚eet of Chevy Volts could deliver an economic â€œbeneï¬t stackâ€ sufï¬cient to enable scalable, microgrid business models. 
The project tightly integrates the performance of the various DERs within the microgrid via TimberRockâ€™s Distributed Energy Resources Management System (DERMS) called De-MAP. De-MAP serves as the integration platform for both the DERs and the external management systems. The DERs are aggregated and managed as a single block of capacity allowing them to â€œstraddle the meterâ€ and be dispatched to deliver value to both the host site â€“ delivering cost-effective energy and reducing demand charges â€“ and the grid by providing services like frequency regulation.

The project represents the ï¬rst commercial deployment of OnStarâ€™s Smart Grid solutions which allows EVs to be integrated with a microgrid and directly managed as grid-interactive resources. PJM, the grid operator, was heavily involved with the project since its inception and the Maryland Energy Administration has awarded the project their prestigious Game Changer award.

"Yokohama Smart City Project, SCADA Virtual Battery",Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Electro-chemical,600,0:0.00,Operational,Electric Bill Management,Electric Energy Time Shift,Electric Supply Capacity,Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning,,,,,,,,,35.4437078,139.6380256,Yokohama,Kanagawa,Japan,,,"The Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP) is an effort to develop a model for smart cities by means of cooperation between citizens, private companies, and the municipality, and to export the successful model to Japan and the rest of the world. Large-scale operational experiments are being held with Yokohama. The hierarchical bundling of energy management systems (EMS) enables energy management at the level of individual EMS and demand-side management at the level of the overall system. 
One of the most unique undertakings of the Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP) is the storage battery SCADA. SCADA stands for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition and is a device monitoring and control system. The storage battery SCADA uses multiple storage batteries as one massive virtual battery to control battery charging and discharging. This type of system is nearly unprecedented anywhere in the world, and creating the system has made it possible to achieve moderated demand response (DR).  Participating in the project are Toshiba Corporation, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Incorporated, Hitachi, Ltd., Meidensha Corporation, NEC Corporation, Sharp Corporation, and Sony Energy Devices Corporation.                             
Two types of batteries are controlled by the storage battery SCADA: large batteries used to adjust electric power supply and demand; and stationary batteries used in homes, commercial buildings, and so on. The batteries used for supply and demand adjustments are lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Toshiba (300 kW), Hitachi (100 kW), and NEC and Meidensha Corporation through joint development (200 kW), providing total output of 600 kW. Batteries designed for users were installed in homes and commercial buildings by Sony Energy Devices, and batteries for office buildings in Yokohama were installed by Sharp.
The storage battery SCADA performs three types of functions to control these batteries: daily operation, short-cycle supply and demand adjustment, and reserve power operation. The moderated DR mentioned above is achieved by daily operation.
Specifically, the storage battery SCADA sends inquiries to home and commercial building users about their spare battery capacity on the following day. The responses received indicate how much spare capacity is available and when, as well as indicating that operations of a certain type are planned for a specific time, and therefore the remaining capacity may be used freely. Based on these responses, the storage battery SCADA borrows the spare capacity of user batteries and charges the batteries from the power grid at times when power demand is relatively low.
The power company estimates the shortfall in electric power compared to the amount of power needed at peak times based on daily demand forecasts and supply plans. The storage battery SCADA receives requests from the power company, gathers spare battery capacity equal to the amount of the shortfall, and stores power. In addition, when sending inquiries about spare capacity to users, the system also asks how much the users want to be paid per kilowatt hour as an incentive (payment is made for capacity actually used in 30-minute increments). The storage battery SCADA selects batteries in homes and commercial buildings up to the required storage capacity starting with the lowest incentives. In this way, the electric power company can provide the necessary power by discharging batteries when electricity supply and demand is tight.
The second function, short-cycle supply and demand adjustment, is a method of using supply and demand adjustment batteries to make up for the shortfall in short-cycle adjustment capacity provided by thermal electricity generation and hydroelectric power resulting from the introduction of renewable energy, which is subject to output fluctuations. Load frequency control is performed.
The third function, reserve power operation, discharges supply and demand adjustment batteries during emergencies such as when an accident occurs to the power grid in order to minimize the effects of the accident.

The regenerative power storage system combines five 360 kW units connected in parallel, each with a converter and lithium-ion battery. 
The E3 Solution System has been operating since July 2012. The system utilizes power more efficiently by absorbing energy generated during the braking of railcars, storing it in the lithium-ion batteries via the converter and then supplying it to railcars during acceleration. The stored energy is also used to stabilize the overhead contact line voltage.
